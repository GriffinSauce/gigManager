Tools for band gigs are often overengineered (entire CRM/tourplanning systems) or underengineered (crummy excel sheets), the idea with Gig Manager is to just keep it simple and get out of the way.

So:

- Note upcoming and potential gigs with relevant fields, mostly freeform
- A little sprinkle of smarts here and there (ie. venue name/location is a maps link, perhaps show driving times)
- Accessible to all band members -> mobile and desktop friendly, easy (but secure) sharing

^ all the above is a brainstorm of ideas and subject to heavy change
